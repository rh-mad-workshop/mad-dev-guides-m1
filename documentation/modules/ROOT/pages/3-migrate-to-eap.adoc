= 3. Migrate to JBoss EAP - 30 minutes
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

In this step you will migrate some Weblogic-specific code in the app to use standard (Jakarta EE) interfaces.

== 3.1. Jump to Code

Let's jump to code containing identified migration issues. Expand the *monolith* source project in the MTA explorer and navigate to `monolith > src > main > java > com > redhat > coolstore > utils > StartupListener.java`. Be sure to click the arrow next to the actual class name `StartupListener.java` to expand and show the Hints:

TIP: You can use kbd:[CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+p] on Mac OSX) to quickly open a file.  Simply start typing the name of the file in the text box that appears and select your file from the list that is produced.

image::mta_project_issues.png[mta, 500]

In the Explorer, MTA issues use an icon to indicate their severity level and status. The following table describes the meaning of the various icons:

image::mta-issues-table.png[mta, 700]

== 3.2. View Details about the Migration Issues

Let's take a look at the details about the migration issue. Right-click on `WebLogic ApplicationLifecycleListenerEvent[rule-id:xxx]` in _Hints_ of _StartupListener.java_ file. Click on `View Details`:

image::mta-issue-detail.png[rhamt_project_issues, 900]

The WebLogic `ApplicationLifecycleListener` abstract class is used to perform functions or schedule jobs in Oracle WebLogic, like server start and stop. In this case we have code in the `postStart` and `preStop` methods which are executed after Weblogic starts up and before it shuts down, respectively.

In Jakarta EE, there is no equivalent to intercept these events, but you can get equivalent
functionality using a _Singleton EJB_ with standard annotations, as suggested in the issue in the MTA report.

We will use the `@Startup` annotation to tell the container to initialize the singleton session bean at application start. We
will similarly use the `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` annotations to specify the methods to invoke at the start and end of
the application lifecyle achieving the same result but without using proprietary interfaces.

Using this method makes the code much more portable.

== 3.3. Fix the ApplicationLifecycleListener issues

[INFO]
====
In this section we're going to deal with the following two issues from the report:

image::report_applifecycle_issues.png[Lifecycle Issues]
====

To begin we are fixing the issues under the Monolith application. Click on `WebLogic ApplicationLifecycleListenerEvent[rule-id:xxx]` in _Hints_ of _StartupListener.java_ file:

image::mta-issue-open-code.png[rhamt_project_issues, 900]

You can also navigate to the `cloud-native-workshop-v2m1-labs` folder in the project tree, then open the file `monolith/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/StartupListener.java` by clicking on it.

Replace the file content with:

[.console-input]
[source,java]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;
import javax.annotation.PreDestroy;
import javax.ejb.Startup;
import javax.inject.Singleton;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@Singleton
@Startup
public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @PostConstruct
    public void postStart() {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void preStop() {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
----

[NOTE]
====
Where is the Save button? VS Code will autosave your changes, that is why you can’t find a SAVE button - no more losing code because you forgot to save. You can undo with kbd:[CTRL-Z] (or kbd:[CMD-Z] on a Mac) or by using the `Edit -> Undo` menu option.

In case you see the red lines in the source code, you can't ignore it because they are the migration issues rather than compliation errors.
====

== 3.4. Test the build

Open a Terminal window. 

image::new-terminal.png[new-terminal, 700]

In the terminal, issue the following command to test the build:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/monolith clean package
----

If it builds successfully (you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`), let’s move on to the next issue! If it does not compile, verify you made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

[.console-output]
[source,sh]

== 3.5. View the diffs

You can review the changes you've made. On the left, click on the _Version Control_ icon, which shows a list of the changed files. Double-click on `StartupListener.java` to view the differences you've made:

image::codeready-workspace-diffs.png[diffs, 800]

VS Code keeps track (using Git) of the changes you make, and you can use version control to check in, update, and compare files as you change them.

For now, go back to the _Explorer_ tree and lets fix the remaining issues.

=== 5. Fix the logger issues

[INFO]
====
In this section we'll be looking to remediate this part of the migration report:

image::report_logging_issues.png[Logging Issues]
====

Some of our application makes use of Weblogic-specific logging methods like the `NonCatalogLogger`, which offer features related to logging of
internationalized content, and client-server logging.

The WebLogic `NonCatalogLogger` is not supported on JBoss EAP (or any other Java EE platform), and should be migrated to a
supported logging framework, such as the JDK Logger or JBoss Logging.

We will use the standard Java Logging framework, a much more portable framework. The framework also
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/logging/overview.html#a1.17[supports
internationalization^] if needed.

In the same `monolith` directory, open the `src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/OrderServiceMDB.java` file and replace its contents with:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty;
import javax.ejb.MessageDriven;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.jms.JMSException;
import javax.jms.Message;
import javax.jms.MessageListener;
import javax.jms.TextMessage;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

@MessageDriven(name = "OrderServiceMDB", activationConfig = {
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup", propertyValue = "topic/orders"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType", propertyValue = "javax.jms.Topic"),
    @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "acknowledgeMode", propertyValue = "Auto-acknowledge")})
public class OrderServiceMDB implements MessageListener {

    @Inject
    OrderService orderService;

    @Inject
    CatalogService catalogService;

    private Logger log = Logger.getLogger(OrderServiceMDB.class.getName());

    @Override
    public void onMessage(Message rcvMessage) {
        TextMessage msg = null;
        try {
                if (rcvMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
                        msg = (TextMessage) rcvMessage;
                        String orderStr = msg.getBody(String.class);
                        log.info("Received order: " + orderStr);
                        Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);
                        log.info("Order object is " + order);
                        orderService.save(order);
                        order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {
                            catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());
                        });
                }
        } catch (JMSException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }

}
----

That one was pretty easy.

== 3.6. Test the build

Build and package the app again just as before:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/monolith clean package
----

If builds successfully (you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`), then let’s move on to the next issue! If it does not compile, verify you made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

== 3.7. Remove the Weblogic EJB Descriptors

[INFO]
====
In this and the following few sections we'll be addressing this part of the report

image::report_mdb_issues.png[MDB Issues, 1100]

To highlight in a little more detail:

* `Call of JNDI lookup` - Our apps use a weblogic-specific
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Naming_and_Directory_Interface[JNDI^] lookup scheme.
* `Proprietary InitialContext initialization` - Weblogic has a very different lookup mechanism for InitialContext objects
* `WebLogic InitialContextFactory` - This is related to the above, essentially a Weblogic proprietary mechanism
* `WebLogic T3 JNDI binding` - The way EJBs communicate in Weblogic is over T2, a proprietary implementation of Weblogic.

====

All of the above interfaces have equivalents in JBoss, however they are greatly simplified and overkill for our application which uses JBoss EAP’s internal message queue implementation provided by https://activemq.apache.org/artemis/[Apache ActiveMQ Artemis^].

[NOTE]
.A word about JMS
====
In this final step we will again migrate some Weblogic-specific code in the app to use standard Java EE interfaces, and one JBoss-specific interface.

Our application uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service[JMS^] to
communicate. Each time an order is placed in the application, a JMS message is sent to a JMS Topic, which is then consumed by
listeners (subscribers) to that topic to process the order using
https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gipko.html[Message-driven beans^], a form of
Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) that allow Java EE applications to process messages asynchronously.

In this case, `InventoryNotificationMDB` is subscribed to and listening for messages from `ShoppingCartService`. When an order
comes through the `ShoppingCartService`, a message is placed on the JMS Topic. At that point, the `InventoryNotificationMDB`
receives a message and if the inventory service is below a pre-defined threshold, sends a message to the log indicating that the
supplier of the product needs to be notified.

Unfortunately this MDB was written a while ago and makes use of weblogic-proprietary interfaces to configure and operate the MDB.
MTA has flagged this and reported it using a number of issues.

JBoss EAP provides an even more efficient and declarative way to configure and manage the lifecycle of MDBs. In this case, we can
use annotations to provide the necessary initialization and configuration logic and settings. We will use the `@MessageDriven`
and `@ActivationConfigProperty` annotations, along with the `MessageListener` interfaces to provide the same functionality as
from Weblogic.

Much of Weblogic’s interfaces for EJB components like MDBs reside in Weblogic descriptor XML files. Use kbd:[CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+p] on a Mac) to Quickly Open
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` to see one of these descriptors. There are many different configuration
possibilities for EJBs and MDBs in this file, but luckily our application only uses one of them, namely it configures
`<trans-timeout-seconds>` to 30, which means that if a given transaction within an MDB operation takes too long to complete
(over 30 seconds), then the transaction is rolled back and exceptions are thrown. This interface is Weblogic-specific so we’ll
need to find an equivalent in JBoss.
====

The first step is to remove the unneeded `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file from the **Project Explorer** (not the **Migration Assistant**). This file is proprietary to Weblogic and not recognized or processed by JBoss EAP. Delete the file by right-clicking on the `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file from the **Project Explorer** and choosing **Delete**, and click **OK**.

[TIP]
====
If you have the tab for the `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file open (or handy) you can quickly find it in the Project Explorer by right-clicking on the tab and then selecting **Reveal in Explorer** as shown.  You can also use the kbd:[ALT+R] (or kbd:[Option+R] on Mac).

image:reveal_in_explorer.png[reveal-in-explorer, 600]
====

image::codeready-workspace-delete-jar.png[codeready-workspace-convert, 500]

While we’re at it, let’s remove the stub weblogic implementation classes added as part of the scenario.

Whilst still in the Project Explorer, right-click on the `src/main/java/weblogic` folder and select *Delete* to delete the folder:

image::codeready-workspace-delete-weblogic.png[codeready-workspace-convert, 500]

== 3.8. Fix the code

Use kbd:[CTRL+p] (or kbd:[CMD+p] on a Mac) to Quickly Open the `monolith/src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/InventoryNotificationMDB.java` file and replace its contents with:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import javax.ejb.ActivationConfigProperty;
import javax.ejb.MessageDriven;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.jms.JMSException;
import javax.jms.Message;
import javax.jms.MessageListener;

import java.util.logging.Logger;

@MessageDriven(name = "InventoryNotificationMDB", activationConfig = {
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationLookup", propertyValue = "topic/orders"),
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destinationType", propertyValue = "javax.jms.Topic"),
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "transactionTimeout", propertyValue = "30"), #<.>
        @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "acknowledgeMode", propertyValue = "Auto-acknowledge")})
public class InventoryNotificationMDB implements MessageListener {

    private static final int LOW_THRESHOLD = 50;

    @Inject
    private CatalogService catalogService;

    @Inject
    private Logger log;

    public void onMessage(Message rcvMessage) {
        TextMessage msg;
        {
            try {
                if (rcvMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
                    msg = (TextMessage) rcvMessage;
                    String orderStr = msg.getBody(String.class);
                    Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);
                    order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {
                        int old_quantity = catalogService.getCatalogItemById(orderItem.getProductId()).getInventory().getQuantity();
                        int new_quantity = old_quantity - orderItem.getQuantity();
                        if (new_quantity < LOW_THRESHOLD) {
                            log.warning("Inventory for item " + orderItem.getProductId() + " is below threshold (" + LOW_THRESHOLD + "), contact supplier!");
                        }
                    });
                }


            } catch (JMSException jmse) {
                System.err.println("An exception occurred: " + jmse.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<.> Remember the `<trans-timeout-seconds>` setting from the `weblogic-ejb-jar.xml` file? This is now set as an
`@ActivationConfigProperty` in the new code. There are pros and cons to using annotations vs. XML descriptors and care should be taken to consider the needs of the application.

Your MDB should now be properly migrated to JBoss EAP.

Lastly, remove Maven dependency on *org.jboss.spec.javax.rmi:jboss-rmi-api_1.0_spec*. In JBoss EAP 7.3(or later), artifact with groupId _org.jboss.spec.javax.rmi_ and artifactId _jboss-rmi-api_1.0_spec_ are unsupported dependencies. Remove the following dependency in `monolith/pom.xml`:

image::mta-remove-dependency.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

== 3.9. Test the build

Build once again:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
mvn -f $PROJECT_SOURCE/monolith clean package
----

If builds successfully (you will see `BUILD SUCCESS`). If it does not compile, verify you
made all the changes correctly and try the build again.

== 3.10. Re-run the MTA report

In this step we will re-run the MTA report to verify our migration was successful.

Click on `Run` icon to analyze the WebLogic application:

image::mta-rerun-report.png[rhamt_rerun_analysis_report, 700]

Migration Toolkit for Applications (MTA) CLI will be executed automatically in a new terminal then it will take a few mins to complete the analysis. Click on `Open Report`:

image::mta-analysis-rerun-complete.png[MTA Add App, 700]

[NOTE]
====
If it is taking too long, feel free to skip the next section and proceed to step *13* and return back to the analysis later to confirm that you
eliminated all the issues.
====

== 3.11. View the results

Click on the latest result to go to the report web page and verify that it now reports 0 Story Points:

You have successfully migrated this app to JBoss EAP, congratulations!

image::rhamt_project_issues_story.png[rhamt_project_issues_story, 700]

[NOTE]
====
You should be aware that this type of migration is more involved than the previous steps, and in real world applications it will
rarely be as simple as changing one line at a time for a migration. Consult the
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/migration_toolkit_for_applications/[MTA documentation^] for more
detail on Red Hat’s Application Migration strategies or contact your local Red Hat representative to learn more about how Red Hat
can help you on your migration path.
====

== 3.12. Test the application on JBoss EAP locally

In this development environment (GitPod), a JBoss EAP server is already running with a PostgreSQL database. Click on `Start Wildfly server` terminal in the VS Code, take a look at if the EAP server is running properly:

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/2-eap-running.png" width=700 align=center>
</p>

image::eap-running.png[eap-running, 700]

Copy the packaged application (.war file) to the running EAP server. Run the following command in the `Pre-warm Maven` terminal in GitPod:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
cp $GITPOD_REPO_ROOT/target/ROOT.war /workspace/deployments/
----

Go back to the `Start Wildfly server` terminal in GitPod where EAP was started for you, and you'll see `ROOT.war` is deployed:

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/2-eap-deployed.png" width=700 align=center>
</p>

image::eap-deployed.png[eap-deployed, 700]

> **Hint:** If you accidentally closed the terminal that was running Wildfly, you can restart Wildfly with `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -b 0.0.0.0`

You can also find out that the inventory data is created in PostgreSQL. Run the following `psql` command in the GitPod Terminal:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+attributes,macros+"]
----
PGPASSWORD=coolstore123 psql -h localhost -U coolstore monolith -c 'select itemid, quantity from INVENTORY;'
----

The output should look like:

[source,sh]
----
 itemid | quantity
--------+----------
 329299 |      736
 329199 |      512
 165613 |      256

 165954 |       87
 444434 |      443
 444435 |      600
 444436 |      230
 444437 |      300
(9 rows)

== Congratulations!

Now you are using the same application that we built locally on OpenShift. That wasn’t too hard right?

image::coolstore_web.png[coolstore_web, 700]

=== Summary

Now that you have migrated an existing Java EE app to the cloud with JBoss and OpenShift, you are ready to start modernizing the application by breaking the monolith into smaller microservices in incremental steps, and employing modern techniques to ensure the application runs well in a distributed and containerized environment.
